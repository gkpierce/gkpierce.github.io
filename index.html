			                <p> Greetings! Welcome to my website. I'm Gavin, a graduate student at the University of Washington pursuing an M.S. in Biostatistics, with an expected graduation in March of 2023. 
						I'm currently conducting research under the guidance of Dr. Nayak Polissar at <a href="https://www.mwlight.com/">The Mountain-Whisper-Light</a> statistical consulting firm. We are enagaging data from <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx">The National Registry of Exonerations</a> trends to assess discrepancies in exonerations across the United States. </p> 
						
					</p> I have significant experience as a hospitality professional, directly leading teams of over 20 professionals in operational logistics, product knowledge, and the finer details of hospitality. Additionally I offer hospitality consulting services, ranging from specialized cocktail and wine programs to tutorials on service and operational logistics. I continue to offer packages for bars and restaurants in Seattle, Washington, building upon years of consulting in the greater Washington, D.C. area. </p>
					
					<p> I am broadly interested in Statistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging with statistical modeling and machine learning techniques for improving upon those models </p>
			
					<p> For more information about me, please check out my <a href="Gavin Pierce Resume Jan 2023.pdf">resume</a>, or reach out via email or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-pierce-5a1a3625/">linkedin</a>.
